# Known bugs

* Labs cannot be rotated
* modules don't insert in slots if there's not enough modules to fulfill the
  whole request in one go
* death beam wand deals no damage

# Inconsistencies

* Magic orbs take 10 active magic shards to craft, but flux orbs take 50/10/0.05 = 100 active magic shards to craft

# Balancing Notes

* add 10s setup timer for defense wards

# Art

* Rune transformer needs its own sprite
* Rune altar should have a flash animation and a sound when it triggers a recipe
* The burner mining drill should show that its mining area is 4x4 with a rectangle while placing, just as the electric miner does
* The offshore pump "no fuel" icon should be centered
* Resonance spires don't show their orbs, neither in graphics nor in alt mode
* the pipe connections for the conjuration machine are blue, should be gold/pink
* teleportation wand has gun animations
* death beam wand fire animations are borked

# Features

* Hide the research tree from the player
* Maybe make a science with the divination research pack that lets you look
  further ahead in the research tree
* add more triggers to the rune altar
* player movement speed upgrade
