# Orbs

_By thegurke & boesemilch_

You are a wizard waking up in a strange land full of giant insects. You don't remember how you got here or anything about your past life. But you know you must find your way back.

Magic orbs are the source of your power. You don't recall how they work, but you're itching to figure it out. Can you use them to unravel the secrets of magic?

**This mod is substantially more difficult than most other Factorio mods.**

It is meant for Factorio veterans who are looking for harder challenges and a distinct new playing experience.

Basic knowledge of the circuit network is required to finish the game.

Several elements of the game are simplified: you don't need to worry about electricity distribution, you don't need to build for scale, and you don't need to solve complex logistical challengesÂ (no trains or bots). Everything you need to build to unlock the next level of the technology tree fits on one screen. However, the puzzle-solving and timing challenges are significantly harder and require iteration on different designs.

While not likely, it is possible to lose too many orbs such that the game completely deadlocks and winning becomes impossible!

Features:

* Production chains that require solving unique puzzles.
* A tech tree themed around using magic to solve your problems.
* Dangerous magical recipes that explode in your face.
* Fighting your enemies with wands, wards, and potions.
* Time-sensitive crafting recipes.
* Runes whose transformations follow mysterious laws for you to discover.

This mod is currently under active development, so expect savegame-breaking changes (although we will try to minimize these).

Requires Factorio 2.0 Space Age.
