# Known bugs

* Labs cannot be rotated

# Inconsistencies

* Magic orbs take 10 active magic shards to craft, but flux orbs take 50/10/0.05 = 100 active magic shards to craft
* Some buildings still accept vanilla modules

# Balancing Notes

* add 10s setup timer for defense wards

# Art

* Rune transformer needs its own sprite
* Rune altar should have a flash animation and a sound when it triggers a recipe
* Gold plate floor needs a metal sound when building
* The burner mining drill should show that its mining area is 4x4 with a rectangle while placing, just as the electric miner does
* The offshore pump "no fuel" icon should be centered
* Resonance spires don't show their orbs, neither in graphics nor in alt mode
* spoil result of the volatile orb should have an explosion icon
* the pipe connections for the conjuration machine are blue, should be gold/pink

# From playtests

* Attack wand -> death beam wand
