# Known bugs

* Resonance spires don't show their orbs, neither in graphics nor in alt mode

# Inconsistencies

* Magic orbs take 10 active magic shards to craft, but unstable orbs take 50/10/0.05 = 100 active magic shards to craft

# Balancing Notes

* Cleansing orbs take wood to maintain, but there is no renewable source of wood
