# Known bugs

* There is no win condition in the game
* Labs cannot be rotated (fixed commited but not confirmed)
* magic wand throws error messages when trying to insert orbs into machines
* destroyed entities don't leave ghosts. Need to increase ghost timeout

# Inconsistencies

* Magic orbs take 10 active magic shards to craft, but flux orbs take 50/10/0.05 = 100 active magic shards to craft
* change the gun to some kind of magic wand

# Balancing Notes

* There aren't any early game military options
* change defense wards so they don't attack nests
* add 10s setup timer for defense wards
* defense wards should do 50 damage
* should have a magical way to generate steam
* make the magic orb -> active magic shards recipes handcraftable


# Art

* Rune transformer needs its own sprite
* Rune altar should have a flash animation and a sound when it triggers a recipe
* Gold plate floor tiles currently use the concrete tile sprite
* Gold plate floor needs a metal sound when building
* Gold plate floor needs a better sound when walking on it
* Need to remove the crashed spaceship in the beginning of the game since that isn't on-theme
* The burner mining drill should show that its mining area is 4x4 with a rectangle while placing, just as the electric miner does
* The offshore pump "no fuel" icon should be centered
* Resonance spires don't show their orbs, neither in graphics nor in alt mode
* The laser turret base is still visible on the defensive wards
* The defensive wards don't have their own unique sprite yet
* change the color of the magic long-handed inserter
* spoil result of the volatile orb should have an explosion icon

# From playtests

* only give orbs to one player when the tech is researched
* burner inserters take more fuel
* burner inserters leech fuel?
* make telekensis effects quadratic

# Features

* Hide the research tree from the player
* Maybe make a science with the divination research pack that lets you look
  further ahead in the research tree
* add more triggers to the rune altar
* add a magic chest
* player movement speed upgrade
* teleportation wand
