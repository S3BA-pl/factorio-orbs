# Known bugs

* There is no win condition in the game

# Inconsistencies

* Magic orbs take 10 active magic shards to craft, but unstable orbs take 50/10/0.05 = 100 active magic shards to craft

# Balancing Notes

* There aren't any early game military options

# Art

* Rune transformer needs its own sprite
* Rune altar should have a flash animation and a sound when it triggers a recipe
* Gold plate floor tiles currently use the concrete tile sprite
* Gold plate floor needs a metal sound when building
* Gold plate floor needs a better sound when walking on it
* Need to remove the crashed spaceship in the beginning of the game since that isn't on-theme
* The burner mining drill should show that its mining area is 4x4 with a rectangle while placing, just as the electric miner does
* The offshore pump "no fuel" icon should be centered
* Resonance spires don't show their orbs, neither in graphics nor in alt mode

# From playtest

* only give orbs to one player when the tech is researched
* burner inserters take more fuel
* burner inserters leech fuel?
* make telekensis effects quadratic
