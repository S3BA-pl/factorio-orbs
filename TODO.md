# Known bugs

* There is no win condition in the game
* Resonance spires don't show their orbs, neither in graphics nor in alt mode

# Inconsistencies

* Magic orbs take 10 active magic shards to craft, but unstable orbs take 50/10/0.05 = 100 active magic shards to craft

# Balancing Notes

* Cleansing orbs take wood to maintain, but there is no renewable source of wood
* There aren't any early game military options
* Fluid pump should use burner energy source.

# Art

* Rune transformer needs its own sprite
* Rune altar should have a flash animation and a sound when it triggers a recipe
* Gold plate floor tiles currently use the concrete tile sprite
* Gold plate floor needs a metal sound when building
* Gold plate floor needs a better sound when walking on it
* Need to remove the crashed spaceship in the beginning of the game since that isn't on-theme
* The burner mining drill should show that its mining area is 4x4 with a rectangle while placing, just as the electric miner does
