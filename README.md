# Orbs

You are wizard waking up in a unknown land full of giant insects. You don't remember how you got here or anything about your past life. But you know you must find your way back.

Magic orbs are the source of your power. You don't recall how they work, but you're itching to figure it out. Can you use them to amplify your magical powers?

**This mod is substantially more difficult than most other Factorio mods.**

It is meant for Factorio veterans who are looking for harder challenges and a distinct new playing experience.

Several elements of the game have been simplified significantly: you don't need to worry about electricity distribution, you don't need to build for scale, and you don't need to solve complex logistical challengesÂ (no trains or bots). Everything you need to build to unlock the next level of the technology tree fits on one screen. However, it is not straightforward and you'll probably need several iterations to get it working automatically.

Features:

* Production chains that require solving new puzzles you haven't encountered before.
* A tech tree themed around using magic to solve all your problems.
* Extensively uses Factorio 2.0's spoilage mechanic.
* Fighting your enemies with wands and wards.
* Items that explode when spoiling.
* Runes whose transformations follow mysterious laws waiting to be discovered.
* Creating gold from other metals.

This mod is currently under active development, so expect savegame-breaking changes (although we will try to minimize these).
